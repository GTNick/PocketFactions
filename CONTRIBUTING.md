Contributing Guidelines and Agreement
===
Before creating an issue, a pull request or pushing a commit directly with owner/collaborator of the repository, please read the following first.

# License and Agreement
In case of any disputes on the credit, copyright and ownership of the contents in This Repository (see definition below), refer to this section.

## Definition of Terms
* `The Repository`, `This Repository`, `The Repo` and `This Repo` refer to the GitHub repository this file is committed to. If this file is copied, the above terms refer to the GitHub repository that this file is copied to, and the repository that this file is copied from remains unaffiliated.
* `We` and `Us` refers to the organization, LegendOfMCPE. All rights reserved by Us, before this organization is deleted on GitHub, is always reserved by the organization, regardless of the joining or leaving of the members or owners of the organization, or the transferring of The Repository. If this organization is deleted on GitHub, the rights go to the Public Domain and no one should claim it as their own.
* `Issues` and `issue`, case-insensitive, refer to any issues created on This Repo that can be accessed using the URL format `(link of This Repo)/issues/(n)`, where `(n)` is the ID of the issue. **Pull requests are not referred to by this term.**
* `You` refers to the owner of the GitHub account used to create an issue, create a pull request or push a commit directly to This Repo.

## Copyright of the Contribution
The copyright of issue description and comments in the repository, if claimed or argued on, is of course of the author of the comment. However, the comment could be edited by Us or You without prior or further notice, but the copyright is not affected.

By sending a pull request, You reserve the credit of the original author of the contents in the pull request, but You also grant Us the exclusive right to use, modify or delete them if the pull request is merged, and this right cannot be revoked. We do not guarantee that special credit will be given to You when (part of) the contents in The Repo is released/published publicly.

If You are a collaborator or an owner of This Repo, all rights of the content committed directly to The Repo without creating a pull request belong to Us. Even if The Repo is transferred or there are any changes in the membership/ownership of the repo, this right is not affected.

## General Stuffs
This agreement applies to all pull requests, issues and commits to This Repo created/pushed after the time this version of the agreement is pushed to The Repo until the organization LegendOfMCPE is deleted.

We reserve the right of final decision to any disputes on this agreement.

# Guidelines
Please follow these guidelines when contributing, or You may be blocked from the organization.

Generally, the most important rule is not to use The Repository as a forum.

## Issues
* Please do not use the issue tracker as a forum. Some discussion is allowed, but off-topic discussion that affects other people (by making many comments) is disallowed.
* Please try to combine several consecutive comments into the same comment if possible.
* Please only report bugs or suggest features using the issue tracker.
* Please check if such an issue is already opened, still open or closed.
* Please suggest a method to reproduce the bug and, if possible, provide a bug log.
* Reports of issues in development issues are welcome.

## Pull requests
* The coding style should conform to either [the coding style requirements of PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or the observed coding style in The Repo.
* If the base branch of the pull request is a working version, please ensure that the pull request works too.
