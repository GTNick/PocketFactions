Tired of having your players always complaining that their bases are griefed? This plugin can let your players protect their own land by creating teams called **factions**. A faction can be founded using the command `/f create` by a player. Then the faction founder can invite players to join it or players can request to join it.
A faction can claim chunks (16*16 blocks wide, infinitely tall pillars) so that other players cannot grief it. However, to avoid players abusing it and claiming the whole world, they have to pay xEcon money. A faction gains money from its members' donations. It also has to have enough power. Power of a faction is the sum of its members' powers. A player's power is calculated according to his online time, deaths and kills. You can configure the value of this in the config file.
