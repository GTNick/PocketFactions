## BANK SERVICES ##
###################
## Bank interest

# Make sure minimum is smaller than maximum :P

# Usually, there can be different types of loans with different time horizons.

# Each loan type must consist of "amount", "horizon" (in real-life hours) and " maximum" number of that loan allowed to receive.

    amount: 2000
    horizon: 12
    maximum: 1
  large:
    amount: 8000
