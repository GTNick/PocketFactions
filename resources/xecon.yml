## BANK SERVICES ##
###################
#### Bank interest
# Customers can usually receive interest if they save money in banks.
# What should be the range of the hourly interest percentage (compound interest)?
# All factions will receive the same percentage of interest every time interest is given.
# The percentage will be a random number (correct to two decimal places) inside the range.
# Make sure minimum is smaller than maximum :)
bank interest range minimum: 0.75
bank interest range maximum: 1.05
# How often (in minutes) should interest be received?
bank interest receive interval: 60

#### Liabilities from bank
## Bank overdraft
# A faction sometimes forgets to deposit money into bank but they need money urgently. They probably can repay the outstanding balance in a short time.
# To make it more convenient, bank overdraft can be allowed. Bank overdraft is a negative amount of assets, so it is a liability.
# Set the maximum amount of overdraft allowed.
bank max overdraft: 500
# Negative times positive equals negative. If you don't want to take interest from the faction when there is bank overdraft, set this to false.
bank overdraft take interest: true

## Loans
# Bank provides loan to factions. The debtor of the loan is the faction, not the faction founder or owner.
# Usually, there can be different types of loans with different time horizons.
# What types of loan should there be?
# For the examples below, "small" and "large" are loan names.
# Each loan type must consist of "amount", "horizon" (in real-life hours), the "maximum" number of that loan allowed to receive, "interest" percentage to increase and hours of "interval" to increase interest.
# WARNING: loan interest is not supported currently
loan types:
  small:
    amount: 2000
    horizon: 24
    maximum: 2
    interest: 1
    interval: 1
  large:
    amount: 8000
    horizon: 96
    maximum: 1
    interest: 1
    interval: 8
# The total amount of credit (loan + overdraft) allowed
max liability: 9000
# When a faction's bank account, even after bank overdraft, cannot pay its loans (i.e. bankrupt), what should we do?
# You can "disband" the faction, "deposit all cash" of the faction, "unclaim all chunks" of the faction, or "do nothing".
# Order your choice in descending order (put the most desired action first, and if after doing that the problem is still not settled, it will go to the next operation. "disband" and "do nothing" mark the problem as settled and the things after them  If you don't have "disband" there, it will be automatically added.
operations on bankrupt:
  - deposit all cash
  - unclaim all chunks
  - deposit all cash # if chunk unclaim repay is set to account cash, this is useful.
  - disband
