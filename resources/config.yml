## POWER ##
###########
## Power affects how many chunks a faction can claim. Power is not taken when a chunk is claimed, but a faction cannot claim more chunks if the power is not high enough.
## Power of a faction depends on its members. When it loses members, its power drops.

power required to claim a chunk: 1000
# The power of a player increases every hour he is online (not necessarily a continuous hour)
power gained per online hour: 50
# The power of a player decreases if he has not been online that day ("day" calculated in the server's timezone)
power lost per offline FULL day: 40
# The power of a player increases when he kills a player
power gained per player kill: 60

## GAMEPLAY ##
############
## When a faction's power drops too low that no more chunks can be claimed, and in fact its power would not allow it to claim so many chunks, "power overdraft" occurs.
# When sieging is enabled, if a faction has power overdraft, other factions can siege any marginary chunks of the faction by walking in the chunk centre and claim the chunk like from wilderness.
enable sieging: false
## Members of other factions can only siege the marginary chunk if they walk inside enough. Define "inside enough" here.
# If the player is within the number of blocks below of radius of circle centered at the chunk centre, allow them to siege the chunk.
siege radius: 4

# PocketFactions generates a world if the world of a faction's claimed chunk doesn't exist. If you want to specify the seed, put it below.
level generation default seed (leave as null for random): null
